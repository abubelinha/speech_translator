## Speech Translator
This is a translator generate by Google Speech Recognition.
It's the first version, you start to speak in English, and the program translate in French, then speak in French, and the program translate in English.
In the future version, I would like to add language detection instead of a loop between English and French.

## Setup

To run this project, install it locally using pip:

```
$ pip3 install speech_recognition
$ pip3 install pyttsx3
$ pip3 install pyaudio
$ pip3 install googletrans
```
