# Welcome to my Speech Translator (English to French, French to English)

This is a translator generate by Google Speech Recognition.
It's the first version, so far you start to speak in English, and the program translate in French, then speak in French, and the program translate in English.
In the future version, I would like to add language detection instead of a loop between English and French.

-----------------------------------------

First of all you add to install few library:

# pip3 install speech_recognition
# pip3 install pyttsx3
# pip3 install pyaudio
# pip3 install googletrans

-----------------------------------------

Download or copy/past the file into your text editor, and launch the script from your terminal.

In the future, I plan to implement this script (or the final version) into a Raspberry Pi.
